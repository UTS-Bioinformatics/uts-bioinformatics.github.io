Ruby holds a Bachelor of Forensic Science (Biology major) from UTS and is currently completing an Honours in Medical Science also at UTS. Her research focuses on the gut-lung axis; exploring how genetic variation in COPD and asthma is linked to the gut microbiome. With a strong interest in human health and disease, she approaches research with curiosity and a problem-solving mindset. Outside of academia, Ruby enjoys staying active through open water swimming and strength training, and finds creative balance through her passion for the visual arts.
