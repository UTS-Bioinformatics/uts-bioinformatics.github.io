Antonia Karabatic is a second year PhD student. She has a vehement interest in genetics, with a particular focus on rare pathogenic genetic variants involved in the development of COPD and early onset emphysema.

Her research focuses on CRISPR screening libraries to identify susceptible genes against cigarette smoke exposure, as well as bioinformatic analysis on the genome sequencing of patients with severe COPD and emphysema. When sheâ€™s not at the lab bench or teaching undergraduate students, she enjoys embroidery, travelling, bird watching and diving into the spider verse.
