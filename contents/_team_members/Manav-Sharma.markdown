Manav Sharma is a second-year PhD student with a strong interest in genetics and respiratory diseases. He previously completed a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in RBMB, where his research focused on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His current doctoral research investigates lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare respiratory disease. The project aims to determine the origin of LAM, identify novel biomarkers, and develop a LAM cell model for research. To achieve this, he combines both wet lab experimentation and bioinformatics approaches, bridging molecular biology with computational analysis. Outside of research, he enjoys practicing martial arts, reading, travelling, and exploring new museums.
