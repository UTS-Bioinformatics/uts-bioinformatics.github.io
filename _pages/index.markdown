Dr Alen Faiz, a molecular pharmacologist and cellular biologist with expertise in bioinformatics and genetic editing, founded the RBMB lab. The RBMB lab research aims to understand the biology of respiratory systems at the genetic and epigenetic levels, including under conditions of exposure to cigarette smoke and current medications (i.e. corticosteroids). The RBMB labs' multidisciplinary skills in high-level integrative bioinformatics and advanced cell culture ensure that its research program can identify associations and then elucidate causal pathways and mechanisms, ultimately impacting to help the development of improved therapies.
